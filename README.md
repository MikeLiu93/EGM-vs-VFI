# EGM-vs-VFI
Try to compare one/two/three decision variables under different computing methods (EGM/VFI)

As the name shows, differnet files have different decision variables, but most assumptions are the same.

The problem is when decision variables are consumption & portfolio choice, EGM and VFI gives different results of optimal risky assets allocation rate when consumption is binding. I suspect that there is something wrong with VFI optimization process.
